## Installation

yadm is used to manage this repo. See [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm).
The default template type (using awk) is used for all templates. 

Simply `yadm clone` for easy setup. Don't bootstrap right away; many
environment variables need to be reset, usually by re-login. Bootstrap with
`yadm bootstrap`.
